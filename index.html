    <p>
        In 2022 I have decided to try something I'd dreamt to do long ago:
        to become a programmer. My choice fall on Python fullstack course
        presented by SkillFactory.
        <br> During my education I have got a lot of information about
        programing languages and their peculiarities, the basis of Python
        and its application. I've got acquainted with Django platform based
        on Python and managed several projects on this platform. There was
        a lot of practice which helps me to look forward with optimism to
        my programming future.
